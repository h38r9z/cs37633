Assignment   5   (due   December   3)Scan   your   solution   to   each   of the   following   four   problems   as   separate   ﬁles   and   submit   them   by   11:59pm   on   the   due   date   via   CrowdMark   (log   in   to   https://app   .crowdmark   .com/sign-in/queensu   using   your   OnQ   account).
1.    The   following   system   of diferential   equations   is   a   model   for   two   competing   populations:

Find allequilibria of this system and classify them.    Compute all therelevanteigenvectors relevant for   drawing   the   phase-plane   diagram.      Sketch   the   phase   plane   diagram   (by   hand)   in   the   ﬁrst   quadrant.
2.    Here   we   consider   an   example   of a   hyperbolic   equilibrium   where   linearization   fails   to   give   the   correct   phase-plane   diagram   close   to   the   equilibrium   (the   conditions   under   which   this   can   happen   will   be   in   later   lectures).      Consider   the   following   function,

The   origin   is   clearly   an   equilibrium   of the   system   
(a)    Show   that   h is   continuously   diferentiable   on   B(0; 1).
(b)    Let      Draw   the   phase-plane   corresponding   to   the   linearized   system    What   is   the   classiﬁcation   and   stability   of the   origin   for   this   linearized   system?
(c)      Transform   the   diferential   equation   to   polar   coordinates.    Show   that   for    r   ≠   0   and   r   <   1,   the   diferential   equation   in   polar   coordinates   is   given   by,

Draw   the   phase-   plane   diagram   corresponding   to   the   nonlinear   system   based   on   this.      Based   on   your   drawing,   what   should   the   classiﬁcation   and   stability   of the   origin   be?
3.    Consider   the   following   system   of equations,
(a)    Show that the   origin   is   an   equilibrium   point   of the   system.    Explain why you   cannot   classify   the   stability   of this   equilibrium   using   linearization.
(b)    Find   a   Lyapunov   function   for   the   origin   associated   with   this   system   using   the   following   form,

(c)      What   is   the   stability   of   the   equilibrium   at   the   origin?      If   it   is   asymptotically   stable,   ﬁnd   the   basin   of attraction.
4.    Let a, b, candd be positive parameters.   Consider the following model of   a chemical reaction   consisting   of two   types   of molecules   (x   and   y   represent   the   concentrations   of the   molecules).

(a)      Find   all   the   equilibria   of this   system.
(b)    Classify   the   equilibria   and   determine   stability   if   d   ∈ (0,   b).
(c)    Classify   the   equilibria   and   determine   stability   if   d > b.
(d)      Draw bifurcation diagram of   the system showing das the bifurcation parameter   (in the   horizontal   axis)   and   x in   the   vertical   axis.    Identify   the   bifurcation   that   occurs   at   d = b.
